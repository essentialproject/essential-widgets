<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This Protégé Tab Widget integrates the knowledge base containing the Essential Architecture Manager repository with the Essential Viewer Reporting Service. This integration is achieved by sending a snapshot of the knowledge base from the modelling environment to the Essential Viewer environment.</p>
<p>This tab provides a generic XML export of the instances in the Protégé knowledge base to any HTTP server that can receive an HTTP POST. The URL to send the XML export is set in the tab service URL field.</p>

<h3>Additional Widgets</h3>
<h4>AutoText widget</h4>
<p>Also included in this Protégé plug-in is the Essential AutoText Widget, which can be used to 
automatically generate values for a String Slot based on the values of other slots on a Form. See the Help for this plug-in for more details.</p>
